Our team is planning to build an android application. 
This application will have sign up page, login page, forgot password page, home page, and will be connected to a database. 
The main goal of the application is to let the students know the timings of a particular professor and schedule an appointment with them. 
This application allows students to know the office time of professor, schedule an appointment with them and cancel the appointment. 
This application also allows professors to change their availability. 
The sign-up page will have different fields such as username, password, confirm password, student/employee, email address and phone number. 
Validations will be done to each field based on the criteria. 
The login page will have username and password as input fields. 
From the login page if username and password are correct, the application takes us to the home page. 
Based on the user type i.e., student/employee, the home page will be different. 
The forgot password page will have username field as input. 
If the username is there in database, an email will be sent to the usernameâ€™s registered email address with their password. 
The home page for students will have the list of professors. 
If they click on a particular professor, it directs to the next page where the available slots will be shown. 
If the professor is available at a particular slot, the button will be highlighted otherwise not. 
If the student makes an appointment, an email will be sent to both student and professor to let them know about the scheduled appointment. The home page for professors will have their time slots populated. They can modify/delete a particular time slot. NOTE: Password will be encrypted when saved to database.
